# BUG-0128 — Native float arithmetic used for financial values in BlockEngine.ts:276

## Symptom

Financial calculations or representations (prices, amounts, balances, etc.) are using native number/f64 arithmetic (`Number()`, `parseFloat()`, `.toFixed()`, `f64` fields) instead of `Decimal.js`. This violates the institutional-grade standard of zero tolerance for floating-point inaccuracies in financial data.

## Evidence

**Derived**, from reading the code.

File: `src/components/shared/backgrounds/engines/BlockEngine.ts`
Line: 276

```typescript
public onTrade(trade: { type: 'buy' | 'sell', price: number, amount: number }): void {
```

## Cause

The developer used native JavaScript `number` types or WebAssembly `f64` types, or associated methods like `Number()`, `parseFloat()`, or `.toFixed()` for fields that represent money (prices, amounts, balances, fees, costs).

## Fix

Refactor the code to use `Decimal.js` for all financial calculations, types, and formatting.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A test reproduces the defect and fails without the fix
- [ ] The test passes with the fix
- [ ] No native float arithmetic is used for financial values in this location
