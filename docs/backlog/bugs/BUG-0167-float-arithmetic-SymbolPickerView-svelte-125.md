# BUG-0167 — Native float arithmetic used for financial values in SymbolPickerView.svelte:125

## Symptom

Financial calculations or representations (prices, amounts, balances, etc.) are using native number/f64 arithmetic (`Number()`, `parseFloat()`, `.toFixed()`, `f64` fields) instead of `Decimal.js`. This violates the institutional-grade standard of zero tolerance for floating-point inaccuracies in financial data.

## Evidence

**Derived**, from reading the code.

File: `src/lib/windows/implementations/SymbolPickerView.svelte`
Line: 125

```typescript
const changeA = Number(snapshot[a]?.priceChangePercent || 0);
```

## Cause

The developer used native JavaScript `number` types or WebAssembly `f64` types, or associated methods like `Number()`, `parseFloat()`, or `.toFixed()` for fields that represent money (prices, amounts, balances, fees, costs).

## Fix

Refactor the code to use `Decimal.js` for all financial calculations, types, and formatting.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A test reproduces the defect and fails without the fix
- [ ] The test passes with the fix
- [ ] No native float arithmetic is used for financial values in this location
