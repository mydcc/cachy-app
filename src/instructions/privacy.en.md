# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2026

At Cachy ("we", "us", or "our"), we value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our application.

## 1. Responsible Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:
**Email:** feedback@cachy.app

## 2. Data Storage
**Local Storage:**
Cachy is designed as a local-first application. Most of your data, including trade history, settings, and journal entries, is stored locally on your device using your browser's "Local Storage". This data remains on your device and is not sent to our servers for permanent storage.

**Backup & Restore:**
You can create backups of your data. These are JSON files generated on your device. It is your responsibility to keep these backup files secure.

## 3. External Services & APIs
To provide market data and functionality, the app interacts with the following external services:

*   **Bitunix & Binance:** We fetch real-time market data (prices, funding rates, etc.) from these exchanges. While we proxy some requests to avoid CORS issues, we do not store your API keys on our servers. API keys stored in your settings are kept in your browser's Local Storage.
*   **ImgBB:** If you choose to upload screenshots for your journal entries, these images are uploaded to ImgBB. Please refer to ImgBB's privacy policy for how they handle data.

## 4. Tracking & Analytics
**Matomo:**
We use Matomo for privacy-friendly analytics to understand how our app is used and to improve it.
*   Matomo is hosted by us (on `s.cachy.app`) to ensure data ownership.
*   We use IP anonymization.
*   This data is used solely for usage analysis and is not shared with third parties for advertising purposes.

## 5. Your Rights
Since your data is primarily stored on your device, you have full control over it. You can delete your data at any time by clearing your browser's cache/local storage or using the "Reset" functions within the app.
